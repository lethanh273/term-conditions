* I keep database.yml for your convenience. Pls change to your postgres credentials.

* rake db:create && rake db:migrate

* rspec ./spec

* For clause and sections I used reference id to refer to the id in the data since I assume we have an admin section where we create clause and section dynamically. I tried to put the right method in right class for maintainability. I think my code is generic enough for now for expanding later. I also tried to make good naming conventions.

* It took me around 3 hours. I would put more edge cases validations with more time.
